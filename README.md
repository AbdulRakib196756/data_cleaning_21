# FIFA 21 Player Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a data cleaning project focused on FIFA 21 player data. The project involves various data cleaning tasks, including modifying the "Club" column, processing the "Contract" column, and adding new columns such as "Start Date," "End Date," and "Contract Length." Additionally, data cleaning tasks were performed on the "Height," "Weight," "W/F" (Weak Foot), and "Hits" columns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of FIFA 21 player information. The original dataset may contain missing, inconsistent, or inaccurate data that requires cleaning and preprocessing.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Club Column
The "Club" column was modified to ensure consistency and accuracy in the club names. This might involve correcting misspelled club names, standardizing naming conventions, and filling in missing values.

### 2. Contract Column
The "Contract" column was processed to extract relevant information such as the start date, end date, and contract length. This information can be crucial for further analysis.

### 3. New Columns
Three new columns were added to the dataset:
- **Start Date**: Represents the start date of the player's contract.
- **End Date**: Represents the end date of the player's contract.
- **Contract Length**: Represents the length of the player's contract in months or years.

### 4. Height Column
The "Height" column may contain data in different formats (e.g., feet and inches or centimeters). Standardization was applied to ensure that all heights are represented consistently, such as converting all heights to centimeters.

### 5. Weight Column
The "Weight" column may contain data in different units (e.g., pounds or kilograms). Standardization was applied to ensure that all weights are represented consistently, such as converting all weights to kilograms.

### 6. W/F Column
The "W/F" column, which stands for Weak Foot, may contain categorical data representing the player's skill with their weaker foot (e.g., 3-star or 4-star). Any inconsistencies in this column were addressed to ensure uniformity.

### 7. Hits Column
The "Hits" column likely represents some form of popularity or engagement metric for the player. Cleaning and preprocessing were performed on this column as needed to make it suitable for analysis.

## Usage
To use this repository for your own data cleaning project or analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fifa21-data-cleaning.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries, if any, by checking the project's dependencies.

3. Run the data cleaning scripts or Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository to perform the cleaning tasks mentioned above.

4. Utilize the cleaned dataset for your analysis, machine learning models, or other data-related tasks.
